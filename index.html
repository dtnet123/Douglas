            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">birthdays and drinking brought them to see each other more
              and more often. so here's a fun fact on dtnet's birthday night.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">that night after having the birthday dinner, their friends decided to go to
              Ministry of Sound, and the birthday boy got himself so drunk that he told jackiechanyt that he got a set
              of mahjong at home (which he did not), and dated to play together 2 days later.
              since the birthday boy could only recall there was a mahjong date, but not the part which he told her he
              'got a set of mahjong', we all showed up with no one got the mahjong set.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">luckily dtnet is a responsible boy and a dedicated mahjong
              player, he travelled from west to east London to borrow his friend's set, and returned with what he had
              promised when he was drunk.</p>

            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">during the beginning of living together, they had a horror
              movie marathon for a period of time, until a point where they don't find them 'horror' anymore, but
              boring. still they kept on watching, because it was the quality time that matters :)</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">one day, jackiechanyt got bored and curious about dtnet's
              online poker game, she asked him to teach her the game of poker.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">this is when jackiechanyt's pandora box was opened.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">dtnet started to bring jackiechanyt to casinos for poker
              sections.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Fun Fact: jackiechanyt plays never bluffs when she first played
              poker, she would fold aces pre-flop if someone all-in, or even queens on pre-flop when someone raised half
              or more of her stacks. whenever she raised during a hand, even though its always the minimum bet, for sure
              she got an A++ hand. other players on the table would usually smile and make a friendly joke about it. she
              got dtnet very frustrated.</p>

            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">to this stage, jackiechanyt and dtnet had a rapid growth on
              their feelings towards each other.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">they do silly things together, for examples:</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">for once jackiechanyt did a make up on dtnet, to improve his
              poker face before they go to the casino for poker.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">dtnet once cooked a 'medium-rare' steak on a hot pan for 17
              minutes, as he trusted the instructions given on the package of the streak. the steak tuned out to be rock
              solid.</p>
            <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">jackiechanyt claimed that she was good in League of Legends,
              and main 'Vayne'. they both got into a custom game at their friends house, dtnet got destroyed by her. Not
              until 2 weeks after, dtnet found out it was her friend who was playing.</p>

              <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">and he only ran on the wheel during nighttime.</p>
              <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">there was actually one night, their neighbor called the police claiming she heard a disturbing banging noise from our flat for an hour or two, and suspected that someone got kidnapped or in need for help.</p>
              <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">since then the little devil moved home into dtnet and jackiechanyt's bedroom, right next to their bed</p>
              <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">after a short period of time, dtnet accidentally trained bi-li something.</p>
              <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">due to the amount of noise bi-li produce with his wheel during late hours, dtnet would use his feet to stop the wheel. Usually when bi-li leaves the wheel, dtnet with remove his feet and get back to sleep.</p>
              <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">not long after, bi-li figured out. whenever the wheel was stopped, he would leave the wheel and wait for awhile, then get back on the wheel.</p>
